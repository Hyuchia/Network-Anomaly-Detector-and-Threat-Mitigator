# Network Anomaly Detector and Threat Mitigator (N.A.D.T.M)

This project is meant to be used as a way to detect botnet activity inside a network, however, since the checks it 
performs are pretty general, it could be used to detect any kind of malware activity.

The ideal device to run this in is on a Raspberry Pi that can monitor your network without the possibility of getting
compromised, however, it can be run on any device with **Windows, macOS or Linux**.

This project will detect anomalous behavior on the network, such as:

* Attempts of DDoS attacks (incoming and outgoing)
* Connections to non-whitelisted IP addresses outside of working ours (defined 7 am to 10 pm)
* Connections to blocklisted IP addresses
* Detection of defined keywords on any packets' payload

When one of the previous behaviors is detected, there are 3 actions that can be executed:

* Shut Down Interface (`-I`): This will shut down the network interface in order to prevent the spreading of malware or bot replication as well as any malicious activity
* Change Network Settings (`-N`): This will change the device to another network (The other network should be dedicated to malware analysis and ideally made out of honeypots)
* Nothing: No action will be taken

## Assets

This project uses different assets to work with and they are available under the `assets` directory. These assets include:

* Blocklists: Lists of known malicious IPs
* Keyworkds: List of keywords the program should look for on the packets' payload
* Whitelists: Lists of IPs that should be whitelisted when a connection to them happens outside of the working hours interval

Further information on how these assets are used is discussed later on this document.

## Technology Stack

Up next is the relevant information about the technologies being used on this project.

### [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Rust is programming language created by Mozilla with a blazing fast speed, comparable to that of C and modern features that
allow developers to create safe, fast and resource efficient code. 

Rust is a `trait` oriented programming language and has no garbage collector, instead it uses timelines and scopes to 
determine if a variable is valid, increasing performance and avoiding access to variables which value is no longer available.

Since the goal of this project is to have a really small resource usage footprint and perform efficiently to avoid affecting
the performance of the host device, this language was selected.


### [HashMap AVL](https://github.com/solotzg/rs-hash-ord)

Every list mentioned on the Assets section, is loaded into a List struct. Since these lists can countain thousands of records,
it was really important to select a good data structure that allowed fast insertions, updates and searchs. An implementation
of a HashMap with an AVL tree on every node (used to deal with hash collitions) was selected. 

While a common HashMap implementation has a very good time complexity of O(n) in the worst case scenario, under a hash
collision attack that can go up to O(n^2), on this implementation, a collision attack is only O(n log n). This is a very 
specific case and while it is not a threat under the current conditions of this project, it was decided we should plan for 
the future in case this structure was ever used on other operations.


## How it Works

The program is started by providing the name of the network interface from where the traffic will be analysed.

The Action flag can also be provided to specify what action should be performed in case anomalous activity is detected.
If no action is defined, it defaults to nothing.

Flags:
* `-I`: Shut Down Interface
* `-N`: Change Network Settings

```bash
./network-anomaly-detector-and-threat-mitigator <Interface_Name> [<Action_Flag>]
```

Examples:

```bash
./network-anomaly-detector-and-threat-mitigator eth0
```

```bash
./network-anomaly-detector-and-threat-mitigator eth0 -I
```

```bash
./network-anomaly-detector-and-threat-mitigator eth0 -N
```

Once the program is started, it will start picking up the packets on the network, analysing them and in case anomalous 
activity is detected, the provided action will be perfomed.

## How Checks are Perfomed

While checks are performed for every packet, only the packets that come from or that have as destination this host device 
(the one running this program) trigger the actions.

### Blocklisted IPs
When the program starts, all the lists of malicious IPs are loaded into a `List` and then, addresses on received packets
are checked against such list in order to detect if there was a connection to them.

### Non-Whitelisted Connections Outside of Working Hours
If a packet is received outside of working hours (defined as 7am - 10 pm), the source and destination addresses are 
checked against a whitelist. If they are on it, then the connection is considered normal and no action is taken.

### DDoS Attacks
Every time a connection is made with an IP address, its time is registered. A weight is also stored for such connection
and this weight is decreased when a connection is made with less than 500 milliseconds of difference from the last one
to the same address. If this weight reaches a certain threshold, it may indicate a DDoS attack.

The weight is increased if the connection is made with a difference of more than 500 milliseconds.

### Payload Keywords
It is known that C&C servers use certain commands to control the bots registered to their botnet. As with the blocklists
and whitelists, there's a keyword list available and loaded on runtime. When a packet is received, the contents on its 
payload are transformed into a `string` and then it checks if any of the keywords is present on that string.
